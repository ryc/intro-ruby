# question: What is exception handling and what roblem does it solve?

# answer: Exception handling is a way to deal with exceptions raised by 
# a program in a predictable and systematic way. It solves the problem 
# of a program exiting without proceeding further at the occurence of 
# the first exception.

# Exception handling changes the flow of control to achieve this.
