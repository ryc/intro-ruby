I have looked at ruby docs and Rails docs APIs
I am starting to get a hang of the docs for Ruby
and will be exploring these as lot going forward.

Not knowing much about Rails yet, the interface seems
much more intuitive in the sense that what a specific method
does and what it returns is clearly spelled out as opposed
to Ruby where it is not so clear at first glance.
