# methods - exercise 6

# what does the following error message(lines 4 thru 7) tell you?
#ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
#  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
#  from (irb):4
#  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

# answer: that the method calculate_product expects 2 argument and only one was
# passed to it

# after I watched the answer video I learned that we can also tell from the
# error message (from (irb):4)that the method invocation happened on line 4
