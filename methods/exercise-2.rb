# methods - exercise 2
# what do the following expressions evaluate to?

x = 2
# this expression is variable assignment and a variable assignment 
# returns (a.k.a evaluates to) the assigned value - in this case
#  integer 2
puts x = 2
# in this expression, the variable assignment is passed to the method puts
# and puts outputs the return value of the expression i.e 2 and return nil
p name = "Joe"
# p also like puts outputs the return value of the variable assignment 
# passed as an argument and also (unlike puts) returns return value of the 
# variable assignment, in this case - the string "Joe"
four = "four"
# the value of the variable assignemnt i.e the string "four" is returned
print something = "nothing"
# this evaluates to nil since print returns nil
