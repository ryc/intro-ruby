# methods - exercise 5
# 2 part question
# first to edit the code from ex4 to make the code print words
# to the screen

def scream(words)
  words = words + '!!!!'
  puts words
end

scream("Yippeee")

# second part of the question - what does the code return now
# answer: the evaluated result of the last line of the method invocation
# is the return value i.e nil since the method puts always returns nil
